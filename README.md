# p2p-video-conferencing

This repository contains a function web app implementation of a video conferencing software. Through the use of PeerJS and a PeerServer, it is a peer-to-peer system that does not rely on a server for each user to stay connected; instead they are connected in a network among themselves. The backend consists of a Node.js app with Express.js as the server-side middleware. EJS has been used as the templating engine for Express. <br>

Another implementation is that of Three.js to create an interactive 3D globe on the landing page. This is not integral to the project, but having learnt 3D modelling recently I wished to test its usability in the frontend.
